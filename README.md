# Ansible LAMP stack

No bells and whistles, just a LAMP stack.

### Getting started

Before you can run the provision you will need to run `script/bootstrap` to
setup the MySQL configuration. Once that is running you can then run
`vagrant provision` and kick off the provisioning using the inbuilt ansible
provider for Vagrant.
